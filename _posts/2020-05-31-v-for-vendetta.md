> Voila! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran…  
> …cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.  
> This visage, no mere veneer of vanity…  
> …is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.  
> However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified…  
> …and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice…  
> …and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.  
> The only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta…  
> …held as a votive not in vain, for the value and veracity of such…  
> …shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.  
> Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose.  
> So let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you…  
> …and you may call me V.  
  
> Good evening, London.  
> I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine…  
> …the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition.  
> I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration…  
> Whereby important events of the past…  
> …usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful, bloody struggle…  
> …are celebrated with a nice holiday…  
> …I thought we could mark this November the 5th…  
> …a day that is, sadly, no longer remembered…  
> …by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat.  
> There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.  
> Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones…  
> …and men with guns will soon be on their way.  
> Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation…  
> …wards will always retain their power.  
> Words offer the means to meaning…  
> …and, for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.  
> And the truth is…  
> …there is something terribly wrong with this counrty, isn't there?  
> Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.  
> And where once you had the freedom to object…  
> …to think and speak as you saw fit…  
> …you now have censors and surveillance coercing your conformity…  
> …and soliciting submission.  
> How did this happen? Who's to blame?  
> Certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.  
> And they will be held accountable.  
> But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty…  
> …you need only look into a mirror.  
> I know why you did it.  
> I know you were afraid.  
> Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.  
> There were a myriad of problems which conspired…  
> …to corrupt you reason and rob you of your common sense.  
> Fear got the best of you.  
> And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.  
> He promised you order, he promised you peace…  
> …and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.  
> Last night, I sought to end that silence.  
> Last night, I destroyed the Old Bailey…  
> …to remind this country of what it has forgotten.  
> More than 400 years ago, a great citizen wished to imbed the 5th of November…  
> …forever in our memory.  
> His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice and freedom…  
> …are more than words.  
> They are perspectives.  
> So if you seen nothing…  
> …if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you…  
> …then I would suggest that you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked.  
> But if you see what I see…  
> …if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek…  
> …then I ask you to stand beside me, one year from tonight…  
> …outside the gates of Parliament.  
> And together, we shall give them a 5th November…  
> …that shall never, ever be forgot.  
  
> People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.  
  
> The building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it.Symbols are given power by people. Alone, a symbol is meaningless, but with enough people…blowing up a building can change the world.  
  
> Would you dance with me?  
> Now? On the eve of your revolution?  
> A revolution without dancing is a revolution not won'th having.   
> I'd love to.  
  
> How you can be one of the most important things that has happened to me… and yet I know almost nothing about you.  
> I don't know where you were born, who your parents were… if you had any brothers or sisters.  
> I don't even know what you really look like.  
> Evey, please.  
> There is a face beneath this mask… but it's not me.  
> I'm no more that face than I am the muscles beneath it…  
> …or the bones beneath them.  
  
> For 20 years I sought only this day.  
> Nothing else existed…  
> …until I saw you.  
> Then everything changed.  
> I fell in love with you, Evey…  
> …like I no longer believed I could.
