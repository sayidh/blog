I stand alone in the darkness  
The winter of my life came so fast  
Memories go back to childhood  
To days I still recall  
Oh how happy I was then  
There was no sorrow there was no pain  
Walking through the green fields  
Sunshine in my eyes  
I'm still there everywhere  
I'm the dust in the wind  
I'm the star in the northern sky  
I never stayed anywhere  
I'm the wind in the trees  
Will you wait for me forever?
